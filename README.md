# goban-image-crop
A simple tool for batch cropping goban screenshots. I designed this to batch crop screenshots I take and add to Anki flashcards.

Uses OpenCV to detect the stones, and from there it decides where to crop.

Heavy WIP TODO:
- Make it crop
- Improve accuracy against some other dimension, maybe line detection
- Usability/releases
